# CI/CD Pipeline for PHP Project

## Overview
This repository contains the CI/CD pipeline configuration for automating the build, security checks, and deployment of a PHP project using tools such as Jenkins, Bitbucket, SonarQube, Nexus, Docker, OWASP, Trivy, ArgoCD, Kubernetes, and Prometheus & Grafana for monitoring. Additionally, Slack is configured for notifications, and Jira is integrated for tracking repository push/pull changes.

### Key Components:
- **Bitbucket**: Version control system where the PHP project is hosted.
- **Jenkins**: Automation server used to manage and run the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform to build and push Docker images.
- **SonarQube**: Static code analysis tool to ensure code quality.
- **Nexus**: Repository manager to store and distribute artifacts.
- **OWASP Dependency Check**: Tool for checking code vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
- **Trivy**: Vulnerability scanner for Docker images.
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps continuous delivery tool to deploy to Kubernetes.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration platform for deploying and managing applications.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Tools for monitoring the health and performance of the system.
- **Slack**: Notifications system for build status updates.
- **Jira**: Issue tracking system for managing code changes.

## Pipeline Flow
The pipeline is triggered automatically on code push or pull to the Bitbucket repository and follows these steps:

1. **Clone Repository**: The PHP project code is pulled from Bitbucket.
2. **Build PHP App**: Composer is used to install dependencies, and the PHP application is built.
3. **OWASP Dependency Check**: The project is scanned for known vulnerabilities in its dependencies.
4. **SonarQube Code Analysis**: The code is analyzed for quality and potential bugs using SonarQube.
5. **Build Docker Image**: The PHP project is containerized into a Docker image.
6. **Trivy Scan Docker Image**: The Docker image is scanned for vulnerabilities before pushing.
7. **Push Docker Image to Nexus**: The Docker image is uploaded to a Nexus repository.
8. **Deploy to Kubernetes via ArgoCD**: The artifact is automatically deployed to Kubernetes using ArgoCD.
9. **Slack Notification**: Slack notifications are sent on the build status, including both success and failure cases.
10. **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana are used to monitor the system health.

## Pipeline Configuration
Below is the Jenkins pipeline configuration (`Jenkinsfile`):

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        SONARQUBE_SERVER = 'SonarQube Server'
        NEXUS_URL = 'http://<nexus_url>:8081/repository/maven-releases/'

## Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana
- **Prometheus** collects metrics from the application and infrastructure.
- **Grafana** provides dashboards for visualizing metrics, alerting on system health, and keeping track of key performance indicators.

## Slack Notifications
- Notifications are sent to the **#devops** Slack channel on successful or failed builds.

## Jira Integration
- Push or pull events from the Bitbucket repository automatically update Jira issues, providing better traceability for code changes.

## Prerequisites
- **Jenkins** installed and running.
- **SonarQube**, **Nexus**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes** are configured on their respective servers.
- Bitbucket repository access.
- Prometheus and Grafana set up for monitoring.

## Conclusion
This pipeline automates the entire CI/CD process for the PHP project, integrating security and quality checks using OWASP, Trivy, SonarQube, and Docker, and leveraging Kubernetes for deployment. Prometheus and Grafana offer monitoring, while Slack and Jira ensure smooth communication and tracking of repository activities.
